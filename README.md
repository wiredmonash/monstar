> *Connecting Monash students through shared academic experiences and data-driven insights.*

MonSTAR is a digital platform where Monash University students can come together and share their experiences in subjects they've completed, backed by comprehensive SETU data spanning years of student feedback.


## 🚀 Highlights

Here's what makes MonSTAR special:

- **Student-Centered Community**: Real experiences from real students about Monash units
- **Comprehensive SETU Database**: Complete historical data up until Semester 1 of 2025
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Angular, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- **Smart Environment Configuration**: Unified development/production setup with environment variables
- **Easy Development Workflow**: Get started with a single `npm run dev` command
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Seamless profile picture management


## ℹ️ Overview

> *Making academic decisions easier through student experiences and data.*

MonSTAR addresses the challenge many Monash students face: choosing subjects without reliable peer insights. By combining student-generated reviews with historical SETU results, we provide a comprehensive view of what to expect from any unit.

The platform serves as both a community hub where students can share their honest experiences and a data repository where evidence-based decisions can be made about course selections.
