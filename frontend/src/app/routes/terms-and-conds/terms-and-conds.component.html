                This website is created and maintained by the Projects Team at WIRED Monash, the official student society
                of the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University. It serves as an independent platform 
                for Monash University students to share experiences and reviews of units (courses). This platform is not
                officially endorsed by Monash University, its Faculties, or Schools. All content reflects the personal
                opinions of contributors and does not represent the views of Monash University, the Faculty of Information
                Technology, or WIRED Monash.
