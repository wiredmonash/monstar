There is a strong belief within us that the license we have chosen provides not only the best solution for providing you with the essential freedom necessary to use MonSTAR within your projects, but also for maintaining enough copyleft strength for us to feel confident and secure with releasing our hard work to the public. For your convenience we've included our own interpretation of the license we chose, which can be seen below.

Our interpretation of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3: (Quoted words are words in which there exists a definition within the license to avoid ambiguity.)
  1. You must always provide the source code, copyright and license information of MonSTAR whenever you "convey" any part of MonSTAR;
     be it a verbatim copy or a modified copy.
  2. MonSTAR was developed as a library and has therefore been designed without knowledge of your work; as such the following should be implied:
    (a) MonSTAR was developed without knowledge of your work; as such the following should be implied:
        - MonSTAR should not fall under a work which is "based on" your work.
        - You should be free to use MonSTAR in a work covered by the:
            - GNU General Public License version 2
            - GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
            This is due to those licenses classifying MonSTAR as a work which would fall under an "aggregate" work by their terms and definitions;
            as such it should not be covered by their terms and conditions. The relevant passages start at:
            - Line 129 of the GNU General Public License version 2
            - Line 206 of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
    (b) If you have not "modified", "adapted" or "extended" MonSTAR then your work should not be bound by this license, as you are using MonSTAR under the definition of an "aggregate" work.
    (c) If you have "modified", "adapted" or "extended" MonSTAR then any of those modifications/extensions/adaptations which you have made should indeed be bound by this license, as you are using MonSTAR under the definition of a "based on" work.

Our hopes is that our own interpretation of license aligns perfectly with your own values and goals for using our work freely and securely.
